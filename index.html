        <p>The <span class="highlight">red panda</span> is a charming, cat-sized mammal native to the eastern Himalayas, known for its rust-colored fur, bushy tail, and adorable masked face. These arboreal creatures spend most of their time in trees, using their specialized wrist bones (that function like thumbs) to grip bamboo - their primary food source. Despite their name, they're not closely related to giant pandas but share a similar bamboo diet. Unfortunately classified as endangered due to habitat loss, these nocturnal animals with their quiet chirps and whistles represent a unique branch of the carnivore family tree that deserves our protection and admiration.</p>

        <p>The <span class="highlight">snow leopard</span> is a magnificent and elusive big cat that roams the high mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. With its thick, smoky-gray coat patterned with dark rosettes, it blends perfectly into the rocky terrain, earning it the nickname <span class="highlight">"ghost of the mountains."</span> These solitary predators are built for harsh climates, with wide, fur-covered paws that act as natural snowshoes and a long tail for balance on steep cliffs. Despite their power, snow leopards are incredibly graceful, capable of leaping up to <span class="highlight">50 feet</span> in a single bound to chase prey like blue sheep and ibex. Sadly, they are classified as <span class="highlight">vulnerable</span> due to habitat loss, poaching, and climate change, with only an estimated <span class="highlight">4,000â€“6,500</span> remaining in the wild.</p>

    <p> I like <b>Koalas</b> because the look super chill and are peaceful 
      and therefore give off this calmness vibe and are cuddly-looking,
       though are very dangerous animals</p>
