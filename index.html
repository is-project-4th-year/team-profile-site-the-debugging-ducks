        <p>The <span class="highlight">red panda</span> is a charming, cat-sized mammal native to the eastern Himalayas, known for its rust-colored fur, bushy tail, and adorable masked face. These arboreal creatures spend most of their time in trees, using their specialized wrist bones (that function like thumbs) to grip bamboo - their primary food source. Despite their name, they're not closely related to giant pandas but share a similar bamboo diet. Unfortunately classified as endangered due to habitat loss, these nocturnal animals with their quiet chirps and whistles represent a unique branch of the carnivore family tree that deserves our protection and admiration.</p>

        <img src="https://www.marwell.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Zoo-Photographer-Credit-Jason-Brown-Irina-laying-2-edited.jpg.webp" alt="Snow Leopard in mountains">
        <p>The <span class="highlight">snow leopard</span> is a magnificent and elusive big cat that roams the high mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. With its thick, smoky-gray coat patterned with dark rosettes, it blends perfectly into the rocky terrain, earning it the nickname <span class="highlight">"ghost of the mountains."</span> These solitary predators are built for harsh climates, with wide, fur-covered paws that act as natural snowshoes and a long tail for balance on steep cliffs. Despite their power, snow leopards are incredibly graceful, capable of leaping up to <span class="highlight">50 feet</span> in a single bound to chase prey like blue sheep and ibex. Sadly, they are classified as <span class="highlight">vulnerable</span> due to habitat loss, poaching, and climate change, with only an estimated <span class="highlight">4,000â€“6,500</span> remaining in the wild.</p>

      <strong>Favorite Animal:</strong> 
      Tiger. 
      An apex predator, the tiger is known for its strength and agility. 
      It is a symbol of power and courage in many cultures. 
      Technically it should be crowned as king of the jungle. 
      Let us look over some facts. 
      It lives in an actual jungle and it is powerful and larger as compared to a lion.
