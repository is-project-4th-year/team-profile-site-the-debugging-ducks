## What I Have Learnt From This Crash Course
 Muriuki Telvin Mugambi:
 Creating issues and milestones in GitHub helps manage and organize project tasks. Issues track individual items like bugs, tasks, or feature requests, with options to assign users, labels, and link them to projects or milestones. Milestones group related issues and pull requests under a shared goal, such as a release or sprint, helping track progress toward deadlines. They offer a structured way to plan, prioritize, and monitor development work.

Git Merge vs  Git Rebase
Git Merge combines the work of two branches by creating a merge commit and is best used when  a user  want to preserve the history of how branches were merged, as shown in the Git graph.

Advantages:

Maintains the full history of both branches.

Easier to trace how and when branches were merged.

Disadvantages:

Can result in a cluttered commit history when there are frequent merges, especially in collaborative teams.

Git Rebase
Purpose: Moves  a branchâ€™s commits on top of another branch, resulting in a linear commit history.

Best Used When: You want to clean up your commit history before merging changes, especially for pull requests.

Advantages:

Produces a clean, straight-line commit history.

Ideal for simplifying local development before pushing to a remote branch.

Disadvantages:

Rewrites commit history, making it harder to trace individual merge events.

Not recommended on shared or public branches, as it can cause conflicts for collaborators.
