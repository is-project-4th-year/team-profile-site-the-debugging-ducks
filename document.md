## What I Have Learnt From This Crash Course
 Muriuki Telvin Mugambi:
 Creating issues and milestones in GitHub helps manage and organize project tasks. Issues track individual items like bugs, tasks, or feature requests, with options to assign users, labels, and link them to projects or milestones. Milestones group related issues and pull requests under a shared goal, such as a release or sprint, helping track progress toward deadlines. They offer a structured way to plan, prioritize, and monitor development work.
